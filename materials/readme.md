# Materials

This directory contains the questionnaires used in the study; scoring details for questionnaires can be found in the NDCLab [instruments](https://github.com/NDCLab/instruments) repository.  The experimental protocol is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10tD_2dk32-PkNHFoG1CtFjqMiVjf14gKzeq17Ya7d9Q/edit?usp=sharing).

In both Parts 1A and 1B, participants completed the three FIU Toolbox tasks (flanker, DCCS, and n-back) on Pavlovia. These tasks were completed twice in Part 1B, before and after the social interaction task. The links below direct you to the .psyexp experiments and their associated resources over on GitLab, where they may be viewed and/or forked.
