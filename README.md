# Missing-Link

## Project Goals
1) To determine whether there is an association between social anxiety and specific executive functions (task switching, inhibitory control, and working memory);
2) To determine whether relations between social anxiety and executive functions depend on social context (assessment before/after a social interaction) or an individual’s temperament;  
3) To explore more generally how individual differences in cognitive abilities, personality, or social factors relate to mental health outcomes more generally.

## Background & Design
Broadly, this study seeks to identify how social interactions relate to lab measures of cognitive abilities and personality and mental health outcomes such as social anxiety. Prior work suggests individuals with a temperament known as “behavioral inhibition” are more likely to develop social anxiety if they also exhibit particular profiles of cognitive control ability, including impaired task switching or superior inhibitory control (White et al., 2011; Buzzell et al., 2020). However, it remains unclear how much these associations depend on the context in which task switching and inhibitory control are assessed (e.g., before/after social interactions). Additionally, it remains unclear if these associations depend on temperament of the individual, other personality or social factors, or are present for the majority of individuals with social anxiety. Similarly, task switching and inhibitory control are related to the ability to maintain and manipulate information within short-term memory, a process referred to as “working memory”, but the link between working memory, social anxiety and temperament is unknown. Finally, while at least some work has investigated how differences in cognitive control during a social interaction relates to social anxiety (Buzzell et al., 2017), it is not known how assessments of cognitive control before/after social interactions relate to social anxiety. The current study aims to not only close these gaps in the literature, but also provide a broader investigation of how particular cognitive abilities, and personality or social factors, relate to mental health outcomes. Participants will complete a standard battery of questionnaires and executive function tasks (flanker task, dimensional change card sort task, n-back task) before and after participating in a social interaction task with a confederate while audio/video is recorded via Zoom. Half of the participants will be explicitly informed about the upcoming social interaction; all will be fully debriefed following the experiment.
